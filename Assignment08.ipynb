    "### Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programatically download the data from the above link.\n",
    "- Import the data into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "- Show the head of the Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform linear regression on the downloaded dataset, where `y=Highway mpg` and `x=Horsepower`.\n",
    "- What is the coefficient (slope) of your model? What does this number mean?\n",
    "- According to your model, what is `y` when `x=2000`.\n",
    "- Show the regression line on a scatterplot with the other datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `sklearn` create a classifier that can predict the make of a car, based on provided features. The following features should be included:\n",
    "  - `City mpg`\n",
    "  - `Highway mpg`\n",
    "  - `Height`\n",
    "  - `Width`\n",
    "  - `Length`\n",
    "  - `Horsepower`\n",
    "  - `Year`\n",
    "- Show the decisiontree of your model.\n",
    "- Use your model to predict the make of a car.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Did the student programatically download and import the data?\n",
    "2. Did the student correctly display the regression line in a graph`?\n",
    "3. Did the student find the coefficient of the line, and reflect on its meaning?\n",
    "4. Did the student correctly provide their classification model with imported data?"
